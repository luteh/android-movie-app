// Accessing definitions from buildSrc in settings scripts was deprecated in Gradle 5.6.

// Previously, the buildSrc project was built before applying the projectâ€™s settings script and its classes
// were visible within the script. Now, buildSrc is built after the settings script and its classes are not
// visible to it. The buildSrc classes remain visible to project build scripts and script plugins.
